# Project Updates Summary

Here is a simple list of the changes we made to improve the design:

## 1. Budget Calculator (Redesigned)
- **New Look:** Switched to a "Soft Modern" style with rounded corners and light colors.
- **Split Layout:** Divided the screen into two clean sections:
  - **Left:** Your inputs (clean white).
  - **Right:** The Guide (soft teal background).
- **Simpler:** Removed heavy borders and reduced clutter.

## 2. Student Dashboard
- **Recent Activity:** Changed from a plain list to a **Timeline**. Now connects events with a vertical line.
- **Course Cards:** Made cards wider ("Cinematic") with smooth hover animations.
- **Header Fix:** Removed the unwanted green line next to "Welcome back".
- **Visuals:** Adjusted spacing to make everything feel less crowded.

## 3. General Improvements
- **Select Menus:** Added custom teal arrows for a premium look.
- **Code:** Cleaned up CSS errors and fixed spacing.
